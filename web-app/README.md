### Ignore Firebase
We've attempted to use Firebase Functions in order to create a Node.js WebSocket in order to communicate between the FE Vue.js and the Redis AWS Server, but we weren't successful.
The project was deployed to <a href="https://ggadot9says.web.app/">Firebase</a> if you'd like to play with it.
